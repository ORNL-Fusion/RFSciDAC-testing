Building PSPLINE libraries
- I did not bother making a nice build system, feel free!
- This just has a shell script for ezcdf and I make a dead-simple cmake for Pspline

Instructions starting with $ are shell commands, comments/notes are in parentheses

1) Build Pspline libraries (required for ezfit method)

from gfile_Bfield
$cd PSPLINE/ezcdf
modify build.sh and change NETCDF_INC_DIR and FC if necessary
$./build.sh
Should have created libezcdf.a
$cd ../Pspline
Edit CmakeLists.txt and change compiler flags if not using gcc/gfortran
$cmake .
$make
Should have created libpspline.a

2) Build ezfit

from gfile_Bfield
edit build.sh to turn on DEBUG during preprocessing
$./build.sh

3)
